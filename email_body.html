    <p>Dear Representative ______rep______, </p>
    <p>We commonly find ourselves using rhetoric like "the homeless epidemic", and other
    phrases that dehumanize the homeless. However, people wiothout homes are still people,
    and we believe that they deserve the basic right to have a place to sleep.</p>
    <p>However, we find ourselves in a saddening situation, where people believe it is alright
    to create structures in public places that cause discomfort and humiliation. We believe these
    "Hostile Structures" serve no positive purpose to society and need to be removed and replaced
    with kinder, more considerate things.</p>
    <p>A citizen that you represent looked at this space and understood that it is something that is unfair and needs fixing. We at fixthis.space are simply deliverers of their message, and this is what they have to say:</p>
    <p>______msg______</p>
    <p>Picture goes here</p>
    <p>We are all human, and we all deserve respect</p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>A group of concerned citizens</p>
