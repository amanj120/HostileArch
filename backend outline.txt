what will the backend do

input:

JSON
{
    location: xx.xxxxxxxxxxx, yy.yyyyyyyyyyyy
    text: "blah blah blah"
    email: null or has one (no need for a boolean value)
    picture : no eye deer
}

what to do:

use the location to
    - tag the location of the picture (maybe with an address, defo with coordinates, maybe link to google maps, maybe use maps api)
    - find the congressional district the picture was taken in
    - find the name of the congressperson in that district

text
    - used in the email

email
    - if included, cc the citizen to the email chain

picture
    - decode the picture
    - attach picture in email

Other things we DO need to solve:
    - how to decode a picture from a json
    - how to query google maps API (not imminent)
    - how to find the district and congressperson
    - how to send email (how to connect to an account)
    - register a domain name
    - set up flask api on the cloud


Output:
    - return if it was successful or not

stupid sudocode

@app.route("/")
def phatfunc():
    try:
        district, repemail = getLocationInformation(x, y);
        streetaddy = moreInfo(x,y);

        picture = decodePicture();  //cant do this until saurav and tashi get us the encoded picture

        response = makeEmail(district, repemail, streatddy, picture) //figure out how to send emails
        sendEmail(email, response);

        return 100
    except:
        return 200
